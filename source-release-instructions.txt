Creating a self-contained source release of the Zookeeper Python Binding
========================================================================

These instructions will likely need to be updated as the Zookeeper
Python binding evolves.

Run the script ``get_source_files.py`` passing the path to a Zookeeper source
distribution. For example::

   curl http://apache.osuosl.org/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.4.4/zookeeper-3.4.4.tar.gz > /tmp/zookeeper-3.4.4.tar.gz

   python get_source_files.py /tmp/zookeeper-3.4.4.tar.gz

Hack the script if necessary. :)

Update version in setup.py.

Run setup with setuptools (or distutils) in the path::

   python setup.py sdist

Publish the resulting source distribution.

Don't forget to tag the commit and push the changes and the tags. You can
clean up the local directory via::

    git clean -fd
